TO LEARN / TO DO in JS
======================

PROJECTS:
- minesweeper; network version where you can compete against other people (e.g. best time in 10 minutes)
- tetris (also with network version)

- go over the whole JS tutorial again


- re-write the space invaders in one go
- create a molequle simulation; use the 'clouds' from the pong game, creat 1,000 clouds, each with a constant energy (dx/dy), and show that as number of clouds increases, they shake faster
- look at 'speed coding' videos on youtube
- invent games that simlate real life (like a bird flying in the air avoiding airplanes, or a worm trying to eat leaves without falling or being eaten)
- do a zoomin/zoomout on the tree
